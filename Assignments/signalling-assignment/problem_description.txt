There are two client processes C1 and C2, two groups - G1 comprising S1 and S2, and G2 comprising A and B. The main process is S. Clients write into an IPC to share data with S, S sends it to either G1(S1 & S2) or G2(A & B). Initially S is sending all the data beign written by the client process to G1. On receing a signal from process D, it should stop sending to G1 and start sending to G2. On the next signal from D, it again switches the group. Use group signalling and polling to achieve this.
